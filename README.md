## üí° Issue
---
Nord theme provides a beautiful and elegant arctic north-blueish color pallet. Although the theme provides a beautiful shell, the syntax highlighting is very difficult to read.

This project aim's to fix that by using Atoms One Dark Pro Syntax Highlighting within the Nord Theme's shell. This gives us the best of both worlds. A beautiful north blueish shell with the easy readability of One Dark Pro's Syntax legendary highlighting.
