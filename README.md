## Issue
---
Nord theme provides a beautiful and elegant arctic north-blueish color pallet. Although the theme provides a beautiful shell, the syntax highlighting is lacking the necessary contrast to make the code readable.

This project aim's to fix that by using Atoms One Dark Pro Syntax Highlighting color pallette within the Nord theme shell.
